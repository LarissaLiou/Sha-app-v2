According to the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP), Sustainable Development Goal 6 goes beyond drinking water, sanitation and hygiene to also address the quality and sustainability of water resources, which are critical to the survival of people and the planet. The 2030 Agenda recognizes the centrality of water resources to sustainable development and the vital role that improved drinking water, sanitation and hygiene play in progress in other areas, including health, education and poverty reduction.

This time we expect to have people with experience in water and sanitation projects - from the private and public sectors, and maybe from NGOs – who can be introduced and get to say a few words about their work.",,13 Aug 17:30,13 Aug 19:30,networking,climate change,,
